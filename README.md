# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
A review of the production data, provided by the AutorsRUs manufacturing team, on the proposed MechaCar prototypes.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Data provided by the manufacturing team, found here as [MechaCar_mpg.csv](MechaCar_mpg.csv), cover 50 prototypes, produced using multiple design specifications to identify ideal vehicle performance, determined here by MPG, or miles per gallon:

- Vehicle Length
- Vehicle Weight
- Spoiler Angle
- Ground Clearance
- Drivetrain (seen as AWD in figure below)

To predict one variable given another, we use linear regression. To predict one variable's total variance given more than one variable, we use multiple linear regression.
