# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
A review of the production data, provided by the AutorsRUs manufacturing team, on the proposed MechaCar prototypes.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Data provided by the manufacturing team, found here as [MechaCar_mpg.csv](MechaCar_mpg.csv), cover 50 prototypes, produced using multiple design specifications to identify ideal vehicle performance, determined here by MPG, or miles per gallon:

- Vehicle Length
- Vehicle Weight
- Spoiler Angle
- Ground Clearance
- Drivetrain (seen as AWD in figure below)

To predict one variable given another, we use linear regression. To predict one variable's total variance given more than one variable, we use multiple linear regression.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

Data provided by the manufacturing team, found here as [Suspension_Coil.csv](Suspension_Coil.csv), cover 150 individual vehicles, 50 each from three different manufacturing lots. The weight capacities of multiple suspension coils were tested to determine if the manufacturing process is consistent across the three lots.

We first created a total_summary dataframe to find the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of the suspension coil’s PSI across all vehicles.

We then created a lot_summary dataframe to group each manufacturing lot by the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of the suspension coil’s PSI column.
